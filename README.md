# robust-neural-network-control-for-manipulator
Robot neural network rubust control, reference to [1] and [2], RBF neural network is used to approximate the uncertainty of robot system, and the approximation error of RBF neural network is treated as external disturbance of system, which is eliminated by robust control term.
